# Betterleaks

Betterleaks is a tool for **detecting** secrets like passwords, API keys, and tokens in git repos, files, and whatever else you wanna throw at it via `stdin`. If you wanna learn more about how the detection engine works check out this blog: [Regex is (almost) all you need](https://lookingatcomputer.substack.com/p/regex-is-almost-all-you-need).

Betterleaks development is supported by <a href="https://www.aikido.dev">Aikido Security</a>

Wait wtf this isn't Gitleaks. You're right, it's not but it's built by the same people who maintained Gitleaks and ships with some cool new features.

## What's New?
A couple things:
- Parallelized Git Scanning (`--git-workers=8`)
- Optimized Recursive Decoding (for catching those nasty SHA1-HULUD variants)
- [Token Efficiency Filter](https://lookingatcomputer.substack.com/p/rare-not-random)
- Secret Validation — automatically check if a detected secret is live by firing an HTTP request
- Misc optimizations
- Regex engine switching w/ (`--regex-engine=stdlib/re2` or `BETTERLEAKS_REGEX_ENGINE=stdlib`)
- MORE RULES! Ahhh finally!

### Benchmarks

```

### Commands

#### Git

The `git` command lets you scan local git repos. Under the hood, betterleaks uses the `git log -p` command to scan patches.
You can configure the behavior of `git log -p` with the `log-opts` option.
For example, if you wanted to run betterleaks on a range of commits you could use the following
command: `betterleaks git -v --log-opts="--all commitA..commitB" path_to_repo`. See the [git log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) documentation for more information.
If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then betterleaks will attempt to scan the current working directory as a git repo.

If you want faster `git` scans you can enable parallelized `git log -p` with `--git-workers={int}`.

#### Dir

The `dir` (aliases include `files`, `directory`) command lets you scan directories and files. Example: `betterleaks dir -v path_to_directory_or_file`.
If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then betterleaks will scan the current working directory.

#### Stdin

You can also stream data to betterleaks with the `stdin` command. Example: `cat some_file | betterleaks -v stdin`

### Creating a baseline

When scanning large repositories or repositories with a long history, it can be convenient to use a baseline. When using a baseline,
betterleaks will ignore any old findings that are present in the baseline. A baseline can be any betterleaks report. To create a report, run betterleaks with the `--report-path` parameter.

```
betterleaks git --report-path betterleaks-report.json # This will save the report in a file called betterleaks-report.json
```

Once as baseline is created it can be applied when running the detect command again:

```
betterleaks git --baseline-path betterleaks-report.json --report-path findings.json
```

After running the detect command with the --baseline-path parameter, report output (findings.json) will only contain new issues.


## Load Configuration

Betterleaks supports both `betterleaks` and `gitleaks` naming conventions for backwards compatibility. The `betterleaks` variants take precedence.

The order of precedence is:

1. `--config/-c` option:
      ```bash
      betterleaks git --config /home/dev/customconfig.toml .
      ```
2. Environment variable `BETTERLEAKS_CONFIG` or `GITLEAKS_CONFIG` with the file path:
      ```bash
      export BETTERLEAKS_CONFIG="/home/dev/customconfig.toml"
      betterleaks git .
      ```
3. Environment variable `BETTERLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML` or `GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML` with the file content:
      ```bash
      export BETTERLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML=`cat customconfig.toml`
      betterleaks git .
      ```
4. A `.betterleaks.toml` or `.gitleaks.toml` file within the target path:
      ```bash
      betterleaks git .
      ```

If none of the four options are used, then the default config will be used.

## Configuration

Betterleaks offers a configuration format you can follow to write your own secret detection rules:

```toml
# Title for the Betterleaks configuration file.
title = "Custom Betterleaks configuration"

# You have basically two options for your custom configuration:
#
# 1. define your own configuration, default rules do not apply
#
#    use e.g., the default configuration as starting point:
#    https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks/blob/master/config/betterleaks.toml
#
# 2. extend a configuration, the rules are overwritten or extended
#
#    When you extend a configuration the extended rules take precedence over the
#    default rules. I.e., if there are duplicate rules in both the extended
#    configuration and the default configuration the extended rules or
#    attributes of them will override the default rules.
#    Another thing to know with extending configurations is you can chain
#    together multiple configuration files to a depth of 2. Allowlist arrays are
#    appended and can contain duplicates.

# useDefault and path can NOT be used at the same time. Choose one.
[extend]
# useDefault will extend the default gitleaks config built in to the binary
# the latest version is located at:
# https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks/blob/master/config/betterleaks.toml
useDefault = true
# or you can provide a path to a configuration to extend from.
# The path is relative to where gitleaks was invoked,

# while secrets and random strings break into many short tokens (low token efficiency). Strings that

### Additional Configuration

#### Composite Rules (Multi-part or `required` Rules)
Betterleaks ships with composite rules, which are made up of a single "primary" rule and one or more auxiliary or `required` rules. To create a composite rule, add a `[[rules.required]]` table to the primary rule specifying an `id` and optionally `withinLines` and/or `withinColumns` proximity constraints. A fragment is a chunk of content that Betterleaks processes at once (typically a file, part of a file, or git diff), and proximity matching instructs the primary rule to only report a finding if the auxiliary `required` rules also find matches within the specified area of the fragment.

**Proximity matching:** Using the `withinLines` and `withinColumns` fields instructs the primary rule to only report a finding if the auxiliary `required` rules also find matches within the specified proximity. You can set:

- **`withinLines: N`** - required findings must be within N lines (vertically)
- **`withinColumns: N`** - required findings must be within N characters (horizontally)
- **Both** - creates a rectangular search area (both constraints must be satisfied)
- **Neither** - fragment-level matching (required findings can be anywhere in the same fragment)

Here are diagrams illustrating each proximity behavior:

```
p = primary captured secret
a = auxiliary (required) captured secret
fragment = section of data gitleaks is looking at

#### Secret Validation

Betterleaks can automatically check whether a detected secret is live by firing an HTTP request defined in a `[rules.validate]` block. Validation runs asynchronously during the scan with a pool of 10 workers.

Each `[rules.validate]` block describes an HTTP request and an ordered list of **match clauses**. Clauses are evaluated top-to-bottom; the first clause whose conditions all pass determines the finding's status. This first-match-wins design lets a single rule distinguish `valid`, `revoked`, `invalid`, etc. secrets from the same API endpoint. If no clause matches, the result defaults to `unknown`.

Responses are cached in-memory per scan so duplicate requests (e.g., the same API key appearing in multiple files) only hit the network once.

##### Template Variables

Templates use [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) syntax and are supported in `url`, `body`, and `headers`. The following variables are available:

| Variable | Source | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `{{ secret }}` | The captured secret (always available) | `ghp_abc123...` |
| `{{ capture_name }}` | Named regex capture group `(?P<capture_name>...)` | `AKIAIOSFODNN7` |
| `{{ other-rule.capture }}` | Capture group from a required rule (composite rules) | `wJalrXUtnFEMI...` |

**Liquid filters** let you transform values inline:

```toml
# Base64-encode for Basic auth
headers = { Authorization = "Basic {{ secret | prepend: 'api:' | b64enc }}" }

# URL-encode a parameter
url = "https://api.example.com/check?key={{ secret | url_encode }}"

# HMAC-sign a payload
body = "{{ payload | hmac_sha256: secret }}"
```

Available filters: `b64enc`, `b64dec`, `url_encode`, `sha256`, `hmac_sha1`, `hmac_sha256`, `unix_timestamp`, `iso_timestamp`, `json_escape`, `uuid`, `prefix`, `suffix` (plus all [standard Liquid filters](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/)).

For composite rules with multiple required parts, all combinations are tested (cartesian product), and a single `valid` match is enough.

##### Simple Example — GitHub PAT

```toml
[[rules]]
id = "github-pat"
regex = '''ghp_[0-9a-zA-Z]{36}'''
keywords = ["ghp_"]

    [rules.validate]
    type = "http"
    method = "GET"
    url = "https://api.github.com/user"
    headers = { Authorization = "token {{ secret }}", Accept = "application/vnd.github+json" }
    extract = { username = "json:login", name = "json:name", scopes = "header:X-OAuth-Scopes" }

    match = [
        { status = 200, json = { login = "!empty", id = "!empty" }, result = "valid" },
        { status = 401, result = "invalid" },
        { status = 403, result = "invalid" },
    ]
```

##### Complex Example — Slack Bot Token

All responses return 200; differentiated by JSON body content:

```toml
[[rules]]
id = "slack-bot-token"
regex = '''(xoxb-[0-9]{10,13}-[0-9]{10,13}-[a-zA-Z0-9]{24})'''
keywords = ["xoxb-"]

    [rules.validate]
    method = "POST"
    url = "https://slack.com/api/auth.test"
    headers = { Authorization = "Bearer {{ secret }}", Content-Type = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" }
    extract = { url = "json:url", user = "json:user", team = "json:team" }

    match = [
        { status = 200, json = { ok = true }, result = "valid" },
        { status = 200, json = { ok = false, error = ["account_inactive", "token_revoked"] }, result = "revoked", extract = { error = "json:error" } },
        { status = 200, json = { ok = false }, result = "invalid" },
        { status = 400, result = "invalid" },
    ]
```


##### Match Clauses

If no clause matches, the result defaults to `UNKNOWN`. You do not need to add an explicit catch-all `{ result = "unknown" }` clause.

**Match clause fields:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | int or list of ints | Response status code must be one of these values. `status = 200` and `status = [200, 201]` are both valid. |
| `words` | list of strings | Body must contain at least one of these strings (any match). Case-insensitive. |
| `words_all` | bool | If `true`, body must contain **all** `words` |
| `negative_words` | list of strings | Body must **not** contain any of these strings. Case-insensitive. |
| `json` | inline table | GJSON path assertions that must all be satisfied. Keys are [GJSON paths](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md), values can be: a scalar for exact match, `"!empty"` for existence check, or a list for one-of matching (e.g. `error = ["revoked", "inactive"]`). |
| `headers` | inline table | Response header assertions. Keys are header names (case-insensitive), values are expected substrings (case-insensitive). |
| `result` | string | **Required.** One of: `valid`, `invalid`, `revoked`, `unknown`, `error` |
| `extract` | inline table | Per-clause extractor override. See Extractors below. |

##### Extractors

Extractors pull data from the HTTP response into finding metadata. They are defined as a map of output names to source-prefixed expressions:

| Prefix | Source | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `json:` | GJSON path on response body | `json:user.login`, `json:repos.#.name` |
| `header:` | Response header value | `header:X-OAuth-Scopes` |

Extractors can be defined at the `[rules.validate]` level (default for all clauses) or on individual match clauses (overrides the default). Array results from JSON paths are joined with commas.

```toml
[rules.validate]
# Default extractors — used by any clause that doesn't define its own
extract = { username = "json:login", scopes = "header:X-OAuth-Scopes" }

match = [
    { status = 200, result = "valid" },
    # This clause overrides the default extract:
    { status = 200, json = { ok = false }, result = "invalid", extract = { error = "json:error" } },
]
```

##### Validation Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `VALID` | Secret is live and active |
| `INVALID` | Secret is not recognised — stale or never valid |
| `REVOKED` | Secret was once valid but has been revoked |
| `UNKNOWN` | Validation ran but could not determine status |
| `ERROR` | Network/request error — the request itself failed |
| *(empty)* | Validation was not attempted (no `[rules.validate]` block) |

##### CLI Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--validation` | `true` | Master toggle — set `--validation=false` to skip all validation |
| `--validation-status` | *(all)* | Comma-separated list of statuses to include in output: `valid`, `invalid`, `revoked`, `error`, `unknown`, `none`. Use `none` to include findings from rules without a validation block. |
| `--validation-extract-empty` | `false` | Include empty/nil extracted values in output |
| `--validation-timeout` | `10s` | Per-request HTTP timeout |
| `--validation-full-response` | `false` | Include full HTTP response body in the finding output |

```bash
# Only show valid findings (excludes non-validatable rules)
betterleaks git --validation-status valid

# Show valid findings + all non-validatable rules
betterleaks git --validation-status valid,none

# Show valid and revoked
betterleaks dir --validation-status valid,revoked

# Disable validation entirely
betterleaks git --validation=false
```

#### betterleaks:allow / gitleaks:allow

If you are knowingly committing a test secret that betterleaks will catch you can add a `betterleaks:allow` (or `gitleaks:allow` for backwards compatibility) comment to that line which will instruct betterleaks
to ignore that secret. Ex:

```
class CustomClass:
    discord_client_secret = '8dyfuiRyq=vVc3RRr_edRk-fK__JItpZ'  #betterleaks:allow

```

#### .betterleaksignore / .gitleaksignore

You can ignore specific findings by creating a `.betterleaksignore` (or `.gitleaksignore` for backwards compatibility) file at the root of your repo. In release v8.10.0 a `Fingerprint` value was added to the report. Each leak, or finding, has a Fingerprint that uniquely identifies a secret. Add this fingerprint to the ignore file to ignore that specific secret. See the [.gitleaksignore](https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks/blob/master/.betterleaksignore) for an example. Note: this feature is experimental and is subject to change in the future.

#### Decoding

Sometimes secrets are encoded in a way that can make them difficult to find
with just regex. Now you can tell gitleaks to automatically find and decode
encoded text. The flag `--max-decode-depth` tweaks this feature (the default
value "5").

Recursive decoding is supported since decoded text can also contain encoded
text.  The flag `--max-decode-depth` sets the recursion limit. Recursion stops
when there are no new segments of encoded text to decode, so setting a really
high max depth doesn't mean it will make that many passes. It will only make as
many as it needs to decode the text. Overall, decoding only minimally increases
scan times.

The findings for encoded text differ from normal findings in the following
ways:

- The location points the bounds of the encoded text
  - If the rule matches outside the encoded text, the bounds are adjusted to
    include that as well
- The match and secret contain the decoded value
- Two tags are added `decoded:<encoding>` and `decode-depth:<depth>`

Currently supported encodings:

- **percent** - Any printable ASCII percent encoded values
- **hex** - Any printable ASCII hex encoded values >= 32 characters
- **base64** - Any printable ASCII base64 encoded values >= 16 characters
- **unicode** - Unicode escape sequences (`U+XXXX`, `\uXXXX`, `\\uXXXX`) decoded to UTF-8

#### Archive Scanning

Sometimes secrets are packaged within archive files like zip files or tarballs,
making them difficult to discover. Now you can tell gitleaks to automatically
extract and scan the contents of archives. The flag `--max-archive-depth`
enables this feature for both `dir` and `git` scan types. The default value of
"0" means this feature is disabled by default.

Recursive scanning is supported since archives can also contain other archives.
The `--max-archive-depth` flag sets the recursion limit. Recursion stops when
there are no new archives to extract, so setting a very high max depth just
sets the potential to go that deep. It will only go as deep as it needs to.

The findings for secrets located within an archive will include the path to the
file inside the archive. Inner paths are separated with `!`.

Example finding (shortened for brevity):

```
Finding:     DB_PASSWORD=8ae31cacf141669ddfb5da
...
File:        testdata/archives/nested.tar.gz!archives/files.tar!files/.env.prod
Line:        4
Commit:      6e6ee6596d337bb656496425fb98644eb62b4a82
...
Fingerprint: 6e6ee6596d337bb656496425fb98644eb62b4a82:testdata/archives/nested.tar.gz!archives/files.tar!files/.env.prod:generic-api-key:4
Link:        https://github.com/leaktk/gitleaks/blob/6e6ee6596d337bb656496425fb98644eb62b4a82/testdata/archives/nested.tar.gz
```

This means a secret was detected on line 4 of `files/.env.prod.` which is in
`archives/files.tar` which is in `testdata/archives/nested.tar.gz`.

Currently supported formats:

The [compression](https://github.com/mholt/archives?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-compression-formats)
and [archive](https://github.com/mholt/archives?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-archive-formats)
formats supported by mholt's [archives package](https://github.com/mholt/archives)
are supported.

#### Reporting

Betterleaks has built-in support for several report formats: [`json`](https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks/blob/master/testdata/expected/report/json_simple.json), [`csv`](https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks/blob/master/testdata/expected/report/csv_simple.csv?plain=1), [`junit`](https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks/blob/master/testdata/expected/report/junit_simple.xml), and [`sarif`](https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks/blob/master/testdata/expected/report/sarif_simple.sarif).

If none of these formats fit your need, you can create your own report format with a [Go `text/template` .tmpl file](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-templates-in-go#step-4-writing-a-template) and the `--report-template` flag. The template can use [extended functionality from the `Masterminds/sprig` template library](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/).

For example, the following template provides a custom JSON output:
```gotemplate
# jsonextra.tmpl
[{{ $lastFinding := (sub (len . ) 1) }}
{{- range $i, $finding := . }}{{with $finding}}
    {
        "Description": {{ quote .Description }},
        "StartLine": {{ .StartLine }},
        "EndLine": {{ .EndLine }},
        "StartColumn": {{ .StartColumn }},
        "EndColumn": {{ .EndColumn }},
        "Line": {{ quote .Line }},
        "Match": {{ quote .Match }},
        "Secret": {{ quote .Secret }},
        "File": "{{ .File }}",
        "SymlinkFile": {{ quote .SymlinkFile }},
        "Commit": {{ quote .Commit }},
        "Entropy": {{ .Entropy }},
        "Author": {{ quote .Author }},
        "Email": {{ quote .Email }},
        "Date": {{ quote .Date }},
        "Message": {{ quote .Message }},
        "Tags": [{{ $lastTag := (sub (len .Tags ) 1) }}{{ range $j, $tag := .Tags }}{{ quote . }}{{ if ne $j $lastTag }},{{ end }}{{ end }}],
        "RuleID": {{ quote .RuleID }},
        "Fingerprint": {{ quote .Fingerprint }}
    }{{ if ne $i $lastFinding }},{{ end }}
{{- end}}{{ end }}
]
```

Usage:
```sh
$ betterleaks dir ~/leaky-repo/ --report-path "report.json" --report-format template --report-template testdata/report/jsonextra.tmpl
```

## Exit Codes

You can always set the exit code when leaks are encountered with the --exit-code flag. Default exit codes below:

```
0 - no leaks present
1 - leaks or error encountered
126 - unknown flag
```
