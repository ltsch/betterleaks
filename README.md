# Betterleaks

Betterleaks is a tool for **detecting** secrets like passwords, API keys, and tokens in git repos, files, and whatever else you wanna throw at it via `stdin`. If you wanna learn more about how the detection engine works check out this blog: [Regex is (almost) all you need](https://lookingatcomputer.substack.com/p/regex-is-almost-all-you-need).

Wait wtf this isn't Gitleaks. You're right, it's not but it's built by the same people who maintained Gitleaks and ships with some cool new features.

## What's New?
A couple things:
- [Secrets Validation (using CEL)](https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks/blob/510b1b79bee0cab492c65dc6c9f4e2b1a9687e84/config/betterleaks.toml#L2582-L2598) — check if a detected secret is live by firing an HTTP request
- [Token Efficiency Filter](https://lookingatcomputer.substack.com/p/rare-not-random)
- Parallelized Git Scanning (`--git-workers=8`)
- Optimized Recursive Decoding (for catching those nasty SHA1-HULUD variants)
- Misc optimizations
- Regex engine switching w/ (`--regex-engine=stdlib/re2` or `BETTERLEAKS_REGEX_ENGINE=stdlib`)
- MORE RULES! Ahhh finally!

### Benchmarks

Scan times compared against [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) on real-world repos (lower is better):

```

### Commands

#### Git

The `git` command lets you scan local git repos. Under the hood, betterleaks uses the `git log -p` command to scan patches.
You can configure the behavior of `git log -p` with the `log-opts` option.
For example, if you wanted to run betterleaks on a range of commits you could use the following
command: `betterleaks git -v --log-opts="--all commitA..commitB" path_to_repo`. See the [git log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) documentation for more information.
If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then betterleaks will attempt to scan the current working directory as a git repo.

If you want faster `git` scans you can enable parallelized `git log -p` with `--git-workers={int}`.

#### Dir

The `dir` (aliases include `files`, `directory`) command lets you scan directories and files. Example: `betterleaks dir -v path_to_directory_or_file`.
If there is no target specified as a positional argument, then betterleaks will scan the current working directory.

#### Stdin

You can also stream data to betterleaks with the `stdin` command. Example: `cat some_file | betterleaks -v stdin`

### Creating a baseline

When scanning large repositories or repositories with a long history, it can be convenient to use a baseline. When using a baseline,
betterleaks will ignore any old findings that are present in the baseline. A baseline can be any betterleaks report. To create a report, run betterleaks with the `--report-path` parameter.

```
betterleaks git --report-path betterleaks-report.json # This will save the report in a file called betterleaks-report.json
```

Once as baseline is created it can be applied when running the detect command again:

```
betterleaks git --baseline-path betterleaks-report.json --report-path findings.json
```

After running the detect command with the --baseline-path parameter, report output (findings.json) will only contain new issues.


## Load Configuration

Betterleaks supports both `betterleaks` and `gitleaks` naming conventions for backwards compatibility. The `betterleaks` variants take precedence.

The order of precedence is:

1. `--config/-c` option:
      ```bash
      betterleaks git --config /home/dev/customconfig.toml .
      ```
2. Environment variable `BETTERLEAKS_CONFIG` or `GITLEAKS_CONFIG` with the file path:
      ```bash
      export BETTERLEAKS_CONFIG="/home/dev/customconfig.toml"
      betterleaks git .
      ```
3. Environment variable `BETTERLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML` or `GITLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML` with the file content:
      ```bash
      export BETTERLEAKS_CONFIG_TOML=`cat customconfig.toml`
      betterleaks git .
      ```
4. A `.betterleaks.toml` or `.gitleaks.toml` file within the target path:
      ```bash
      betterleaks git .
      ```

If none of the four options are used, then the default config will be used.

## Configuration

Betterleaks offers a configuration format you can follow to write your own secret detection rules:

```toml
# Title for the Betterleaks configuration file.
title = "Custom Betterleaks configuration"

# You have basically two options for your custom configuration:
#
# 1. define your own configuration, default rules do not apply
#
#    use e.g., the default configuration as starting point:
#    https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks/blob/master/config/betterleaks.toml
#
# 2. extend a configuration, the rules are overwritten or extended
#
#    When you extend a configuration the extended rules take precedence over the
#    default rules. I.e., if there are duplicate rules in both the extended
#    configuration and the default configuration the extended rules or
#    attributes of them will override the default rules.
#    Another thing to know with extending configurations is you can chain
#    together multiple configuration files to a depth of 2. Allowlist arrays are
#    appended and can contain duplicates.

# useDefault and path can NOT be used at the same time. Choose one.
[extend]
# useDefault will extend the default gitleaks config built in to the binary
# the latest version is located at:
# https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks/blob/master/config/betterleaks.toml
useDefault = true
# or you can provide a path to a configuration to extend from.
# The path is relative to where gitleaks was invoked,
# not the location of the base config.
# path = "common_config.toml"
# If there are any rules you don't want to inherit, they can be specified here.

# Boolean that enables the Token Efficiency filter for this rule. When enabled, candidate secrets
# are evaluated using BPE tokenization (cl100k_base) to measure how "rare" or non-natural-language
# a string is. Common words and phrases tokenize into fewer, longer tokens (high token efficiency),
# while secrets and random strings break into many short tokens (low token efficiency). Strings that

# that is better at distinguishing true secrets from everyday text. (introduced in Betterleaks v1.0.0).
tokenEfficiency = true

# in conjunction with a valid `regex` entry.

# keywords will perform a quick string compare check to make sure the

## Additional Configuration

## Secrets Validation
**⚠️ Secrets Validation is an experimental feature. To enable it, pass --experiments=validation.**

Betterleaks can automatically verify if a detected secret is live by making an HTTP request defined in the rule's validate field. Validation runs asynchronously, and responses are cached in-memory so duplicate secrets only trigger a single network request.

### CEL Expressions
Rules use [CEL (Common Expression Language)](https://cel.dev/) for validation logic. The expression receives the captured secret, fires an HTTP request (more validation kinds to come), and returns a status map.

### Variables & Functions:

- `secret` (string): The captured secret value.
- `captures` (map): Named capture groups from the rule's regex.
- `http.get(url, headers)` / `http.post(url, headers, body)`: Fires the HTTP request.
- `cel.bind(name, value, expr)`: Binds a variable to avoid repeating sub-expressions.
- `unknown(response)`: Helper returning `{"result": "unknown", "reason": "HTTP <status>"}`.

### The Response Object (r):
- `r.status` (int): HTTP status code.
- `r.body` (string): Raw response body.
- `r.json` (dyn): Parsed JSON body.
- `r.headers` (map): Response headers (all keys lowercased).

### Result Format
Expressions should return a map with a `"result"` key set to `valid`, `invalid`, `revoked`, `unknown`, or `error`. Any additional keys in the map are attached to the finding as metadata.

Example
Here is a standard validation block for a GitHub Personal Access Token. It uses CEL's optional chaining (.? and .orValue()) to safely extract metadata from the JSON response:

```TOML
[[rules]]
id = "github-pat"
regex = '''ghp_[0-9a-zA-Z]{36}'''
keywords = ["ghp_"]
validate = '''
  cel.bind(r,
    http.get("https://api.github.com/user", {
      "Accept": "application/vnd.github+json",
      "Authorization": "token " + secret
    }),
    r.status == 200 ? {
      "result": "valid",
      "username": r.json.?login.orValue(""),
      "name": r.json.?name.orValue(""),
      "scopes": r.headers[?"x-oauth-scopes"].orValue("")
    } : r.status in [401, 403] ? {
      "result": "invalid",
      "reason": "Unauthorized"
    } : unknown(r)
  )
'''
```
Note: For more complex validation setups—such as dynamically constructing URLs, using Basic Auth, or validating multi-part composite rules ([[rules.required]])—check out the existing examples in our built-in rules directory.


## Composite Rules (Multi-part or `required` Rules)
Betterleaks ships with composite rules, which are made up of a single "primary" rule and one or more auxiliary or `required` rules. To create a composite rule, add a `[[rules.required]]` table to the primary rule specifying an `id` and optionally `withinLines` and/or `withinColumns` proximity constraints. A fragment is a chunk of content that Betterleaks processes at once (typically a file, part of a file, or git diff), and proximity matching instructs the primary rule to only report a finding if the auxiliary `required` rules also find matches within the specified area of the fragment.

**Proximity matching:** Using the `withinLines` and `withinColumns` fields instructs the primary rule to only report a finding if the auxiliary `required` rules also find matches within the specified proximity. You can set:

- **`withinLines: N`** - required findings must be within N lines (vertically)
- **`withinColumns: N`** - required findings must be within N characters (horizontally)
- **Both** - creates a rectangular search area (both constraints must be satisfied)
- **Neither** - fragment-level matching (required findings can be anywhere in the same fragment)


## betterleaks:allow / gitleaks:allow

If you are knowingly committing a test secret that betterleaks will catch you can add a `betterleaks:allow` (or `gitleaks:allow` for backwards compatibility) comment to that line which will instruct betterleaks
to ignore that secret. Ex:

```
class CustomClass:
    discord_client_secret = '8dyfuiRyq=vVc3RRr_edRk-fK__JItpZ'  #betterleaks:allow

```

## .betterleaksignore / .gitleaksignore

You can ignore specific findings by creating a `.betterleaksignore` (or `.gitleaksignore` for backwards compatibility) file at the root of your repo. In release v8.10.0 a `Fingerprint` value was added to the report. Each leak, or finding, has a Fingerprint that uniquely identifies a secret. Add this fingerprint to the ignore file to ignore that specific secret. See the [.gitleaksignore](https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks/blob/master/.betterleaksignore) for an example. Note: this feature is experimental and is subject to change in the future.

#### Decoding

Sometimes secrets are encoded in a way that can make them difficult to find
with just regex. Now you can tell gitleaks to automatically find and decode
encoded text. The flag `--max-decode-depth` tweaks this feature (the default
value "5").

Recursive decoding is supported since decoded text can also contain encoded
text.  The flag `--max-decode-depth` sets the recursion limit. Recursion stops
when there are no new segments of encoded text to decode, so setting a really
high max depth doesn't mean it will make that many passes. It will only make as
many as it needs to decode the text. Overall, decoding only minimally increases
scan times.

The findings for encoded text differ from normal findings in the following
ways:

- The location points the bounds of the encoded text
  - If the rule matches outside the encoded text, the bounds are adjusted to
    include that as well
- The match and secret contain the decoded value
- Two tags are added `decoded:<encoding>` and `decode-depth:<depth>`

Currently supported encodings:

- **percent** - Any printable ASCII percent encoded values
- **hex** - Any printable ASCII hex encoded values >= 32 characters
- **base64** - Any printable ASCII base64 encoded values >= 16 characters
- **unicode** - Unicode escape sequences (`U+XXXX`, `\uXXXX`, `\\uXXXX`) decoded to UTF-8

#### Archive Scanning

Sometimes secrets are packaged within archive files like zip files or tarballs,
making them difficult to discover. Now you can tell gitleaks to automatically
extract and scan the contents of archives. The flag `--max-archive-depth`
enables this feature for both `dir` and `git` scan types. The default value of
"0" means this feature is disabled by default.

Recursive scanning is supported since archives can also contain other archives.
The `--max-archive-depth` flag sets the recursion limit. Recursion stops when
there are no new archives to extract, so setting a very high max depth just
sets the potential to go that deep. It will only go as deep as it needs to.

The findings for secrets located within an archive will include the path to the
file inside the archive. Inner paths are separated with `!`.

Example finding (shortened for brevity):

```
Finding:     DB_PASSWORD=8ae31cacf141669ddfb5da
...
File:        testdata/archives/nested.tar.gz!archives/files.tar!files/.env.prod
Line:        4
Commit:      6e6ee6596d337bb656496425fb98644eb62b4a82
...
Fingerprint: 6e6ee6596d337bb656496425fb98644eb62b4a82:testdata/archives/nested.tar.gz!archives/files.tar!files/.env.prod:generic-api-key:4
Link:        https://github.com/leaktk/gitleaks/blob/6e6ee6596d337bb656496425fb98644eb62b4a82/testdata/archives/nested.tar.gz
```

This means a secret was detected on line 4 of `files/.env.prod.` which is in
`archives/files.tar` which is in `testdata/archives/nested.tar.gz`.

Currently supported formats:

The [compression](https://github.com/mholt/archives?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-compression-formats)
and [archive](https://github.com/mholt/archives?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-archive-formats)
formats supported by mholt's [archives package](https://github.com/mholt/archives)
are supported.

#### Reporting

Betterleaks has built-in support for several report formats: [`json`](https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks/blob/master/testdata/expected/report/json_simple.json), [`csv`](https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks/blob/master/testdata/expected/report/csv_simple.csv?plain=1), [`junit`](https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks/blob/master/testdata/expected/report/junit_simple.xml), and [`sarif`](https://github.com/betterleaks/betterleaks/blob/master/testdata/expected/report/sarif_simple.sarif).

If none of these formats fit your need, you can create your own report format with a [Go `text/template` .tmpl file](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-templates-in-go#step-4-writing-a-template) and the `--report-template` flag. The template can use [extended functionality from the `Masterminds/sprig` template library](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/).

For example, the following template provides a custom JSON output:
```gotemplate
# jsonextra.tmpl
[{{ $lastFinding := (sub (len . ) 1) }}
{{- range $i, $finding := . }}{{with $finding}}
    {
        "Description": {{ quote .Description }},
        "StartLine": {{ .StartLine }},
        "EndLine": {{ .EndLine }},
        "StartColumn": {{ .StartColumn }},
        "EndColumn": {{ .EndColumn }},
        "Line": {{ quote .Line }},
        "Match": {{ quote .Match }},
        "Secret": {{ quote .Secret }},
        "File": "{{ .File }}",
        "SymlinkFile": {{ quote .SymlinkFile }},
        "Commit": {{ quote .Commit }},
        "Entropy": {{ .Entropy }},
        "Author": {{ quote .Author }},
        "Email": {{ quote .Email }},
